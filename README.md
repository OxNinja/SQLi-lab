# SQLi-lab ðŸ’‰

An SQL injection playground, from basic to advanced

**Will you solve all the levels?**

![Homepage picture](static/index.png)

## How to use

* Clone the repo
* `./build.sh`
* `firefox http://172.16.0.2`
* Start hacking!

> Tip: add it to your hosts file: `echo '172.16.0.2 sqli.lab' >> /etc/hosts && firefox http://sqli.lab` :smiley:

## Rules

The goal of this lab is to train like a hacker not a script kiddie

* No automated tools (like SQLmap, dirb...)
* Only hand-crafted payloads or home-made scripts

## Other

It's recommended to **not** read the source code. If you are stuck: `Inspect element` for (big) nudges.

I will not provide any solution in this repo, instead I will make a blog post on [my website](https://0xninja.fr) to explain step by step all the levels. You are free to write public solutions on your own blog.
